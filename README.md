# communtiy-advisor-WG
Working group for addressing CA (community advisor)  processes and issues as determined by the Catalyst and broader Cardano community.


# Operations-WG
<p>The Operations Working Group is an initiative created by the current Catalyst Circle CA Representative, Nadia Hopkins.</p>, and replaces some of hte other working groups originally discusses within the Discord server and Miro board.

<br>

<p>The goal of this working working group is to address concerns, issues and future processes as they relate to areas outside the specificity of CA (Community Advicor) and vCA (Veteran Community Advisor) roles wihin the Cardano Catalyst ecosystem. There may be instances where there could be tangential overlap among the groups, in which case the groups will work closely with each other.</p>

<br>

<p>In the absence of an <i>Official Repository</i> this repository will be used to archive community suggestions and issues. As the Catalyst ecosystem matures and an <i>Official Repository</i> has been created, all relevant repositories and account credentials will be transfered to the appropriate governing body for continued use or archival purposes.</p>
